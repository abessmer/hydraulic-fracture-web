  TODO describe this function

  Args:
    del_var (float):  Represents 'del' in the original Matlab code.  (Renamed to avoid keyword conflict)
    lam (float):      Represents 'lam' in the original Matlab code.
    rho (numpy.ndarray): 1D numpy array, representing 'rho' in the original Matlab code.
                         It's assumed to be a vector of rho values.
    type_var (int):   Represents 'type' in the original Matlab code.
                         Determines which function (fcn_M_KGD or fcn_M_rad) is used.

  Returns:
    numpy.ndarray:  1D numpy array 'p', representing the calculated pressure.
